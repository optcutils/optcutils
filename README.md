# OPTCUtils <WIP>
Collection of One Piece Treasure Cruise utilities.

# Dev. information
I try to keep the code as clean as possible, but the folder structure is probably bad. Sorry!

The public and main branch is master, the work branch is develop.

`src/`
  - Contains all the source files, then these get compiled with browserify into their respective
  folders.

`stamina/`
  - Contains all the compiled sources and assets for the Stamina Timer utility.
  
`bookhelper/`
  - Contains all the compiled sources and assets for the BookHelper utility
  
`assets/`
  - Contains all the common assets for every utility.
  
I use Gulp to transpile and minify all the code. Resulting files do not have the .min.js extenion, but are saved in the corresponding folder of it's utility.
